Hey there! I'm Mia and you've found my blog and portfolio.
I do a variety of things, but here are some of my favorites that you might see around here:
- Network Technology and System Administration: What horrifying things can I do on my network lab?
- Programming: I'm not *good* at Rust per se, but I do think it's fun.
- Hobby Rocketry: It has both more and fewer rules than you'd expect!
- Gamedev: I dread and look forward to Devtober in equal measure.
