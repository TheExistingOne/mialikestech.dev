I have no idea how to start this, so I'm going to pretend I'm not posting out into the void and entertain a little bit of cliche. Hi there, I'm Mia, welcome to my blog/projects log/something or other.

Now that I've written an opening that I'm sure will haunt me everytime I remember this, let me try to give this some semblance of structure.

**What is this?**

This is, primarily, a place for me to share the things I'm doing, and ramble about what I'm interested in unimpeded. A lot of that will be project writeups, showing off strange tech stuff I've done, and a handful of devlogs, but some stranger and more off topic things will likely sneak in from time to time. I'll be keeping things quasi-professional in case a potential employer tracks me back to this page (If that's you, hi there!) but I'm not a huge fan of keeping things too serious.

**Why are you doing this?**

I've got a couple of reasons. First of all, it's just helpful to write things down from time to time. It makes it easier to go back and go over old projects and it keeps new ones fresh in my mind. Second, random little blogs like this have helped me out massively on a couple of rough projects and I'd like to think I could eventually help someone like that too with my ramblings. Finally, while I have plenty of people who are willing to try to listen to what I'm working on, I have very few who can manage it without their eyes glazing over. Luckily the internet doesn't have eyes so I can shout into the void to my hearts content

**What's first?**

On the off chance anyone is actually asking what I'm working on, I'm glad you asked! I've got a few things that will probably wind up on here in semi-short order.

*Devtober*: Every October there is a game development challenge to work on a project every day for the month. I'm participating this year and while I'm planning on making in the moment updates on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/realityshift.bsky.social), I'm also going to make longer form periodic logs on here, at the end of each week. There's a [day 1 post]({% post_url 2024-10-01-devtober-day1 %}) that went up at the same time as this one explaining things a little bit more thoroughly.

*Homelab Revamp*: I've been planning an overhaul of my home networking lab for a while now and I really need to sit down and do it. I'm planning to chronicle that process here, which will probably start with migrating from bare metal to Proxmox and setting up iSCSI.

*Rocketry*: I'm working on some interesting software and hardware for a rocketry team at my college, primarily a client/server system based on LoRaWAN. My demo for this is likely going to be Tetris, which I think is neat and very silly, which means some of it will probably end up on here as well.

If you've stuck around for this much of my nonsense already, and any of that sounds interesting, I hope you'll keep an eye out. See you around!
